        <header><h2>Data Types</h2></header>
        <p>Each column in an SQL table declares the type(s) that column may contain. ANSI SQL includes the following data types.</p>
        <h3>Character strings and national character strings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>CHARACTER(n) (or CHAR(n)): fixed-width n-character string, padded with spaces as needed</li>
          <li>CHARACTER VARYING(n) (or VARCHAR(n)): variable-width string with a maximum size of n characters</li>
          <li>CHARACTER LARGE OBJECT(n [ K | M | G | T ]) (or CLOB(n [ K | M | G | T ])): character large object with a maximum size of n [ K | M | G | T ] characters</li>
          <li>NATIONAL CHARACTER(n) (or NCHAR(n)): fixed width string supporting an international character set</li>
          <li>NATIONAL CHARACTER VARYING(n) (or NVARCHAR(n)): variable-width NCHAR string</li>
          <li>NATIONAL CHARACTER LARGE OBJECT(n [ K | M | G | T ]) (or NCLOB(n [ K | M | G | T ])): national character large object with a maximum size of n [ K | M | G | T ] characters</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Binary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>BINARY(n): Fixed length binary string, maximum length n.</li>
          <li>BINARY VARYING(n) (or VARBINARY(n)): Variable length binary string, maximum length n.</li>
          <li>BINARY LARGE OBJECT(n [ K | M | G | T ]) (or BLOB(n [ K | M | G | T ])): binary large object with a maximum length n [ K | M | G | T ].</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Boolean</h3>
        <p>The BOOLEAN data type can store the values TRUE and FALSE.</p>
        <h3>Numerical</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>INTEGER (or INT), SMALLINT and BIGINT</li>
          <li>FLOAT, REAL and DOUBLE PRECISION</li>
          <li>NUMERIC(precision, scale) or DECIMAL(precision, scale)</li>
          <li>DECFLOAT(precision)</li>
        </ul>

        <header><h2>Elements</h2></header>
        <p>The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clauses, which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.)</li>
            <li>Expressions, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows of data</li>
            <li>Predicates, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) (true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow.</li>
            <li>Queries, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of SQL.</li>
            <li>Statements, which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics. SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar.</li>
            <li>Insignificant whitespace is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability.</li>

      <section class="main-section" id="Queries_And_Subqueries">
        <header><h2>Queries and Subqueries</h2></header>
        <p>The most common operation in SQL, the query, makes use of the declarative <code>SELECT</code> statement. <code>SELECT</code> retrieves data from one or more tables, or expressions. Standard <code>SELECT</code> statements have no persistent effects on the database. Some non-standard implementations of <code>SELECT</code> can have persistent effects, such as the <code>SELECT INTO</code> syntax provided in some databases.</p>
        <p>Queries allow the user to describe desired data, leaving the database management system (DBMS) to carry out planning, optimizing, and performing the physical operations necessary to produce that result as it chooses.</p>
        <p>A query includes a list of columns to include in the final result, normally immediately following the <code>SELECT</code> keyword. An asterisk ("*") can be used to specify that the query should return all columns of the queried tables. <code>SELECT</code> is the most complex statement in SQL, with optional keywords and clauses that include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>FROM</code> clause, which indicates the table(s) to retrieve data from. The <code>FROM</code> clause can include optional <code>JOIN</code> subclauses to specify the rules for joining tables.</li>
          <li>The<code>WHERE</code> clause includes a comparison predicate, which restricts the rows returned by the query. The <code>WHERE</code> clause eliminates all rows from the result set where the comparison predicate does not evaluate to True.</li>
          <li>The <code>GROUP BY</code> clause projects rows having common values into a smaller set of rows. <code>GROUP BY</code> is often used in conjunction with SQL aggregation functions or to eliminate duplicate rows from a result set. The <code>WHERE</code> clause is applied before the <code>GROUP BY</code> clause.</li>
          <li>The <code>HAVING</code> clause includes a predicate used to filter rows resulting from the <code>GROUP BY</code/> clause. Because it acts on the results of the <code>GROUP BY</code> clause, aggregation functions can be used in the <code>HAVING</code> clause predicate.</li>
          <li>The <code>ORDER BY</code> clause identifies which columns to use to sort the resulting data, and in which direction to sort them (ascending or descending). Without an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause, the order of rows returned by an SQL query is undefined.</li>
          <li>The <code>DISTINCT</code> keyword eliminates duplicate data.</li>
          <li>The <code>LIMIT</code> clause specifies the number of records to return. Note that this clause is not supported by all SQL databases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following example of a <code>SELECT</code> query returns a list of expensive books. The query retrieves all rows from the Book table in which the price column contains a value greater than 100.00. The result is sorted in ascending order by title. The asterisk (*) in the select list indicates that all columns of the Book table should be included in the result set.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>SELECT *
FROM  Book
WHERE price > 100.00
ORDER BY title;</code>
        </pre>
        <p>The example below demonstrates a query of multiple tables, grouping, and aggregation, by returning a list of books and the number of authors associated with each book.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>SELECT Book.title AS Title,
FROM  Book
JOIN  Book_author
ON  Book.isbn = Book_author.isbn
GROUP BY Book.title;</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Example output might resemble the following:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>Title                  Authors

      </pre>
        <p>Under the precondition that isbn is the only common column name of the two tables and that a column named title only exists in the Book table, one could re-write the query above in the following form:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>SELECT title,
count(*) AS Authors
FROM  Book
NATURAL JOIN Book_author
GROUP BY title;</code>
        </pre>
        <p>However, manyvendors either do not support this approach, or require certain column-naming conventions for natural joins to work effectively.</p>
        <p>SQL includes operators and functions for calculating values on stored values. SQL allows the use of expressions in the select list to project data, as in the following example, which returns a list of books that cost more than 100.00 with an additional sales_tax column containing a sales tax figure calculated at 6% of the price.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>SELECT isbn,
title,
price,
price * 0.06 AS sales_tax
FROM  Book
WHERE price > 100.00
ORDER BY title;</code>
        </pre>
        <h3>Subqueries</h3>
        <p>Queries can be nested so that the results of one query can be used in another query via a relational operator or aggregation function. A nested query is also known as a subquery. While joins and other table operations provide computationally superior (i.e. faster) alternatives in many cases, the use of subqueries introduces a hierarchy in execution that can be useful or necessary. In the following example, the aggregation function AVG receives as input the result of a subquery:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>SELECT isbn,
title,
price
FROM  Book
WHERE price < (SELECT AVG(price) FROM Book)
ORDER BY title;</code>
        </pre>
        <p>a subquery can use values from the outer query, in which case it is known as a correlated subquery.</p>
        <p>Since 1999 the SQL standard allows WITH clauses for subqueries, i.e. named subqueries, usually called common table expressions (also called subquery factoring). CTEs can also be recursive by referring to themselves; the resulting mechanism allows tree or graph traversals (when represented as relations), and more generally fixpoint computations.</p>

        <header><h2>Data Manipulation</h2></header>
        <p>The Data Manipulation Language (DML) is the subset of SQL used to add, update and delete data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>INSERT adds rows (formally tuples) to an existing table, e.g.:</li>
          <pre>
            <code>INSERT INTO example
(column1, column2, column3)
VALUES
('test', 'N', NULL);</code>
          </pre>
          <li>UPDATE modifies a set of existing table rows, e.g.:</li>
          <pre>
            <code>UPDATE example
SET column1 = 'updated value'
WHERE column2 = 'N';</code>
          </pre>
          <li>DELETE removes existing rows from a table, e.g.:</li>
          <pre>
            <code>DELETE FROM example
WHERE column2 = 'N';</code>
          </pre>
          <li>MERGE is used to combine the data of multiple tables. It combines the INSERT and UPDATE elements. It is defined in the SQL:2003 standard; prior to that, some databases provided similar functionality via different syntax, sometimes called "upsert".</li>
          <pre>
            <code>MERGE INTO table_name USING table_reference ON (condition)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
UPDATE SET column1 = value1 [, column2 = value2 ...]
THEN NOT MATCHED THEN
INSERT (column1 [, column2 ...]) VALUES (value1 [, value2 ...])</code>
         </pre>
